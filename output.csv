"Depakote was prescribed to me by a Kaiser psychiatrist in Pleasant Hill, CA in 2006.  The medication was given to help treat the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, Type II.  My disease was misdiagnosed for several years as depression, since I was never seen by a professional during hypomanic episodes, and when I did see a professional, I did not think that my manic symptoms were signs of a serious psychiatric problem.  Anti-depressant drugs were prescribed: Prozac in 2001, which had minimal effect and I stopped taking them a few months later. Wellbutrin was prescribed again for ""chronic depression"" in the spring of 2006, but this medication slowly spun me into an intense manic period.  After the manic episode, I fell very hard into a severe, suicidal depressive state.  I was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric ward in June 2006 to keep me safe and to properly diagnose my condition.  The symptoms I was experiencing before being prescribed the Depakote/Depakene: rapidly cycling mood swings between intense activation and irritablity/excitement and crashing lows and depression, suicidal thoughts, poor logic and decision making, racing thoughts, anxiety, poor concentration, and poor sleep.",depakene,-4,,Maximum,,14

"The first drug I was prescribed after a mastectomy and chemotherapy was Tamoxifen, which I took for almost 1 year.  My oncologist said it increased bone mass, so she wanted to use that first to counteract the bone mass-decreasing side effect of the aromatase inhibitors.  Their protocol is to use Tamoxifen for 2 years, then switch to an aromatase inhibitor for 3 years. However, I had some uterine bleeding ( I am post-menopausal) so they switched to Femara early. Tamoxifen may cause an increase in uterine cancer, which my grandmother had. The most annoying side effect of Femara is the increase in joint pain.  NSAIDs and glucosamine help somewhat but have their own side effects.  That said, I am willing to continue Femara for the next 2 years to help prevent cancer reccurence.  I read in the literature (Medscape) that 51% of women do not complete their 5 yrs of either drug, and my guess is because of side effects.

Unfortunately, it appears that I am still developing a minor bald spot in the middle of my scalp.  



Based on my current rate of hair loss, I'm guessing that I will maintain a healthy head of hair for the next 4-5 years.  At 35, I probably won't care how my hair looks because I'll be well out of the dating game.  



I don't think Propecia is a cure-all for my particular pattern of baldness, but I feel it would be highly effective for others.  Anyone who is experiencing baldness at the back of scalp would benefit greatly.  The receding hairline will probably continue, but at a much slower pace.

I drank and did drugs, but it only made things worse. My doctor prescribed this drug and it did absolute wonders, within a week, I was starting to feel the weight being lifted off my shoulders. Within 3 weeks, I was able to drive in traffic, and open my blinds to let the sun in. Within 2 months, I was back to normal! I have the occasional off days, but who doesn't?

I could be sitting or laying down in bed & these ""spells"" would come on out of the blue & very regularly.  I spent one night up all night laying on the couch because it was so bad that I was afraid that if I fell asleep I might not wake up. I tried to pretend it would go way at first but then made an appointment with my Dr. first & then a cardiologist, it was just too scary. My Dr. didn't believe that it was the medicine. By the time I could get in to see the cardiologist & have the heart monitor holster, echocardiogram etc. done I had been off the medicine for 2 weeks & the symptoms had lessened & of course did not appear while I was being tested. The Dr. thought I was crazy & that there was no way it was the medicine & that maybe I was having panic attacks.  I have never had a panic attack in my life & I have had similar heart rhythm symptoms with other meds that quit when I stopped taking them & I know my own body.  It WAS the lovastatin.  It took a year & a half before I started feeling normal again & didn't have these attacks come on sometimes.  I truly believe the lovastatin had an affect on my heart that took that long to get better. I will NEVER take another cholesterol med again that has the possible side affects of affecting muscles.  The heart is a muscle.  I also found that other people have had this same experience while taking statins while I was researching this on the internet.

"After I turned 38 my skin changed.  It became much oilier and I started having large acne lesions again around my chin.  This was especially true before a period or when I was under stress at work.  I decided to see a dermatologist as I was sick of the acne.  I started Yaz which was alright, as well as Retin-A.  This didn't seem to address the larger lesions so my dr. prescribed Solodyn.  Looking back now, I think the side-effect started in the first couple weeks, I just didn't identify them as related to the drug.  I thought I was suffering from carpal tunnel at work and could explain why my knees hurt so much.  I was just about to go to an orthopod when I decided to investigate the Solodyn more.  I read about the joint pain and Lupus-like symptoms, stopped the drug immediately and called my dr. to get in and see her.  She did some bloodwork and I had a positive ANA blood result (mid-positive, not low).  This is one indicator of lupus.  My dermatologist was adamant that the symptoms would go away now.  I called the office again a week later as I was still having strong side effects and was pretty worried.  I got a phone call back that basically said ""hello, hypochondriac, you do not have lupus.""  Then my eye pain started and my eye turned totally red.  I went to my GP who referred me to an opthalmologist who diagnosed iritis and I started 7 weeks of drops.

I started to feel some of the bad effects (nausea, mental fog, trouble sleeping, sore eyes, constipation, gas) of Champix while taking it but I was determined to quit smoking.  For the first month I felt exceptionally good and I was telling everyone how great it was but the euphoria came crashing down and I went into a deep depression.   I was able to make it through the full 3 month course but when I stopped taking it is when I really got messed up. I developed Psychosis NOS, Major Depressive Disorder, suicidal, Emotional instability, aggression, rage, panic attacks, hallucination, Somatoform Disorder, Delusional Parasitosis (bug crawling sensations all over my body), Hyperacusis (sensitivity to certain frequencies of sound causing severe pain and pressure in my ears), Severe Insomnia, Memory Loss, Brain Fog, Lowered Inhibitions, Hair was constantly hurting all of the time and lost lots of it (27 year old male), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (started as extreme constipation and gas, fatigue, Severe Eye pain, unsightly puffy bags under eyes, excessive weight gain, gingivitis, prostate pain, black out and become out of control when drinking, decreased sexual pleasure and ability to maintain erections. I think that is everything!!! I went to the psych ward recently due to being suicidal and at a breaking point with my symptoms and I was treated like scum and given brain damaging neuroleptic (anti-psychotic) drugs against my will. I have made some small improvements since taking Champix but it looks like the nightmare will never truly end. If you are one of the many that gets burned by this medication be warned that the doctors will probably not be able to help you and will most likely deny that anything is even happening to you or that it is related to Champix and the side effects may be permanent.  I had a similar reaction in respect to rage and disinhibition from taking Zoloft when I was younger which altered my life substantially and now Champix has put the nail in the coffin.  Apparently these two drugs have a similar mechanism but Pfizer with held this information and marketed the drug in a deceiving way not mentioning any of the neuro-psychiatric and mind altering side effects of the drug when it first hit the market in order to boost sales of their poison.  The medical community has know for quite some time that dopamine plays a role in mood regulation and the fact the Champix targets the �pleasure centre� of the brain makes them grossly negligent for not investigating this further and informing consumers.  Many people including myself (I turned down a prescription of Zyban due to my experience with Zoloft) would not have taken it if we would have been informed of the risks and Pfizer knew that.
